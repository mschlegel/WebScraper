WebScrapper is a simple solution that pulls the top holdings of a mutual fund from Google Finance and Morning Star by scraping their web sites.  

At the time of this writing, I had not used the code in about 2 years.  I should have put it on GitHub earlier.  

The code is free to use and to distribute.
